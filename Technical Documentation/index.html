          >So... how do I use a multimeter? This tutorial will show you how to
          use a digital multimeter (DMM), an indispensable tool that you can use
          to diagnose circuits, learn about other people's electronic designs,
          and even test a battery. Hence the 'multi'-'meter' (multiple
          measurement) name.</p
        >
        <p
          >The most basic things we measure are voltage and current. A
          multimeter is also great for some basic sanity checks and
          troubleshooting. Is your circuit not working? Does the switch work?
          Put a meter on it! The multimeter is your first defense when
          troubleshooting a system. In this tutorial we will cover measuring
          voltage, current, resistance and continuity.</p

            current, voltage (V) and resistance (Ω).</p

          <li>Ports</li>
          <p
            >Two probes are plugged into two of the <strong>ports</strong> on
            the front of the unit. <strong>COM</strong> stands for common and is
            almost always connected to Ground or ‘-’ of a circuit. The
            <strong>COM</strong> probe is conventionally black but there is no
            difference between the red probe and black probe other than color.
            <strong>10A</strong> is the special port used when measuring large
            currents (greater than 200mA). <strong>mAVΩ</strong> is the port
            that the red probe is conventionally plugged in to. This port allows
            the measurement of current (up to 200mA), voltage (V), and
            resistance (Ω). The probes have a <i>banana</i> type connector on
            the end that plugs into the multimeter. Any probe with a banana plug
            will work with this meter. This allows for different types of probes
            to be used.</p

        <p
          >To start, let's measure voltage on a AA battery: Plug the black probe
          into COM and the red probe into mAVΩ. Set the multimeter to "2V" in
          the DC (direct current) range. Almost all portable electronics use
          direct current, not alternating current. Connect the black probe to
          the battery's ground or '-' and the red probe to power or '+'. Squeeze
          the probes with a little pressure against the positive and negative
          terminals of the AA battery. If you've got a fresh battery, you should
          see around 1.5V on the display (this battery is brand new, so its
          voltage is slightly higher than 1.5V).</p
        >
        <p
          >If you're measuring DC voltage (such as a battery or a sensor hooked
          up to an Arduino) you want to set the knob where the V has a straight
          line. AC voltage (like what comes out of the wall) can be dangerous,
          so we rarely need to use the AC voltage setting (the V with a wavy
          line next to it). If you're messing with AC, we recommend you get a
          non-contact tester rather than use a digital multimeter.</p
        >
        <p
          >What happens if you switch the red and black probes? The reading on
          the multimeter is simply negative. Nothing bad happens! The multimeter
          measures voltage in relation to the common probe. How much voltage is
          there on the ‘+’ of the battery compared to common or the negative
          pin? 1.5V. If we switch the probes, we define ‘+’ as the common or
          zero point. How much voltage is there on the ‘-’ of the battery
          compared to our new zero? -1.5V!</p
        >
        <p
          >Now let's construct a simple circuit to demonstrate how to measure
          voltage in a real world scenario. The circuit is simply a 1kΩ and a
          Blue super bright LED powered with a SparkFun Breadboard Power Supply
          Stick. To begin, let's make sure the circuit you are working on is
          powered up correctly. If your project should be at 5V but is less than
          4.5V or greater than 5.5V, this would quickly give you an indication
          that something is wrong and you may need to check your power
          connections or the wiring of your circuit.</p
        >
        <code class="warning"
          >Warning! In general, stick to DC circuits (the settings on the
          multimeter with straight lines, not curvy lines). Most multimeters can
          measure AC (alternating current) systems, but AC circuits can be
          dangerous. A wall outlet with AC or 'main voltage' is the stuff that
          can zap you pretty good. VERY carefully respect AC. If you need to
          check to see if an outlet is 'on' then use a AC tester. Really the
          only times we've needed to measure AC are when we've got an outlet
          that is acting funny (is it really at 110V?), or if we're trying to
          control a heater (such as a hot plate). Go slow and double check
          everything before you test an AC circuit.</code

        ><header>Measuring Current</header>
        <p
          >Reading current is one of the trickiest and most insightful readings
          in the world of embedded electronics. It's tricky because you have to
          measure current in series. Where voltage is measure by poking at VCC
          and GND (in parallel), to measure current you have to physically
          interrupt the flow of current and put the meter in-line. To
          demonstrate this, we'll use the same circuit we used in the measuring
          voltage section.</p
        >
        <p
          >The first thing we'll need is an extra piece of wire. As mentioned,
          we'll need to physically interrupt the circuit to measure the current.
          Said another way, pull out the VCC wire going to the resistor, add a
          wire where that wire was connected, and then probe from the power pin
          on the power supply to the resistor. This effectively "breaks" power
          to the circuit. We then insert the multimeter in-line so that it can
          measure the current as it "flows" through to the multimeter into the
          bread board.</p
        >
        <p
          >With the multimeter connected, we can now set the dial to the proper
          setting and measure some current. Measuring current works the same as
          voltage and resistance -- you have to get the correct range. Set the
          multimeter to 200mA, and work from there. The current consumption for
          many breadboard projects is usually under 200mA. Make sure the red
          probe is plugged into the 200mA fused port. On our favorite
          multimeter, the 200mA hole is the same port/hole as voltage and
          resistance reading (the port is labeled mAVΩ). This means you can keep
          the red probe in the same port to measure current, voltage, or
          resistance. However, if you suspect that your circuit will be using
          close to or more than 200mA, switch your probe to the 10A side, just
          to be safe. Overloading the current can result in a blown fuse rather
          than just an overload display. More on that in a bit.</p
        >
        <code class="remember"
          >Remember! When you're done using the meter, always return the meter
          to read voltage (return the probes to the voltage port, set the meter
          to read the DC voltage range if necessary). It's common to grab a
          meter and begin to quickly measure the voltage between two pins. If
          you have left your meter in 'current' mode, you won't see the voltage
          on the display. Instead you'll see '0.000' indicating that there is no
          current between VCC and GND. Within that split second you will have
          connected VCC to GND through your meter and the 200mA fuse will blow =
          not good. So before you put the meter down for the night, remember to
          leave your meter in a friendly state.</code

          they mean, that's ok! There are plenty of online calculators that are
          easy to use. However, if you ever find yourself without internet
          access, a multimeter is very handy at measuring resistance.</p

        <p
          >As a rule of thumb, it's rare to see a resistor less than 1 Ohm.
          Remember that measuring resistance is not perfect. Temperature can
          affect the reading a lot. Also, measuring resistance of a device while
          it is physically installed in a circuit can be very tricky. The
          surrounding components on a circuit board can greatly affect the
          reading.</p

      <section class="main-section" id="Checking_Continuity"
        ><header>Checking Continuity</header>
        <p
          >Continuity testing is the act of testing the resistance between two
          points. If there is very low resistance (less than a few Ωs), the two
          points are connected electrically, and a tone is emitted. If there is
          more than a few Ωs of resistance, than the circuit is open, and no
          tone is emitted. This test helps insure that connections are made
          correctly between two points. This test also helps us detect if two
          points are connected that should not be.</p
        >
        <p
          >Continuity is quite possibly the single most important function for
          embedded hardware gurus. This feature allows us to test for
          conductivity of materials and to trace where electrical connections
          have been made or not made.</p
        >
        <p
          >Set the multimeter to 'Continuity' mode. It may vary among DMMs, but
          look for a diode symbol with propagation waves around it (like sound
          coming from a speaker).</p
        >
        <p
          >Now touch the probes together. The multimeter should emit a tone
          (Note: Not all multimeters have a continuity setting, but most
          should). This shows that a very small amount of current is allowed to
          flow without resistance (or at least a very very small resistance)
          between probes.</p
