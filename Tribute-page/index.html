        <h2 id="tribute-info-title">Early Life</h2>
        <p class="content"
          >Kobe Bean Bryant was born on August 23, 1978, in Philadelphia,
          Pennsylvania. Named after a city in Japan, Bryant is the son of former
          NBA player Joe "Jellybean" Bryant.</p
        >
        <p class="content"
          >In 1984, after ending his NBA career, the elder Bryant took the
          family to Italy, where he played in the Italian League. Growing up in
          Italy alongside two athletic older sisters, Shaya and Sharia, Bryant
          was an avid player of both basketball and soccer. When the family
          returned to Philadelphia in 1991, Bryant joined the Lower Merion High
          School basketball team, leading it to the state championships four
          years in a row. With an eye on the NBA, he also started working out
          with the 76ers.</p
        >
        <p class="content"
          >Though he boasted good grades and high SAT scores, Bryant decided to
          go straight to the NBA from high school. He was selected by the
          Charlotte Hornets with the 13th overall pick of the 1996 NBA draft and
          was subsequently traded to the Los Angeles Lakers.</p
        ><br />

        <h2 id="tribute-info-title">NBA Career and Stats</h2>
        <p class="content"
          >In his second season with the Lakers, Bryant was voted a starter for
          the 1998 All-Star Game, becoming the youngest All-Star in NBA history
          at 19. The shooting guard then teamed up with superstar center
          Shaquille O'Neal to win three consecutive NBA championships and was
          voted first-team all-NBA from 2002-2004. He also inked multi-year
          endorsement deals with Adidas, Sprite and other top sponsors.</p
        >
        <p class="content"
          >Although the Lakers struggled after O'Neal left in 2004, Bryant
          performed brilliantly. He scored 81 points against the Toronto Raptors
          in January 2006, the second-highest single-game mark in NBA history,
          and led the league in scoring that year and the next.</p
        >
        <p class="content"
          >In 2008, Bryant was named Most Valuable Player and carried his team
          to the NBA Finals, where they lost to the Boston Celtics. In the 2009
          NBA Finals, the Lakers beat the Orlando Magic to win the championship.
          Shortly afterward, Bryant was part of the memorial service to honor
          friend and music superstar Michael Jackson. The following year, the
          Lakers won their second straight title by defeating the Celtics.</p
        >
        <p class="content"
          >After suffering a torn Achilles tendon in April 2013, Bryant worked
          hard to return to the court before fracturing his knee just six games
          into the 2013-2014 season. The veteran All-Star surpassed Michael
          Jordan for third all-time on the NBA scoring list in December 2014,
          but his season ended due to injury for the third straight year when he
          sustained a torn rotator cuff in January 2015.</p
        >

        <h2 id="tribute-info-title">Retirement</h2>
        <p class="content"
          >Although Bryant returned in time for the start of the 2015-2016 NBA
          season, he personally struggled alongside his young Lakers teammates.
          In November 2015, he announced that he would retire at the end of the
          season. "This season is all I have left to give," he wrote on The
          Players' Tribune website. "My heart can take the pounding. My mind can
          handle the grind but my body knows it's time to say goodbye."</p
        >
        <p class="content"
          >The announcement drew a strong reaction, particularly from NBA
          Commissioner Adam Silver. "With 17 NBA All-Star selections, an NBA
          MVP, five NBA championships with the Lakers, two Olympic gold medals
          and a relentless work ethic, Kobe Bryant is one of the greatest
          players in the history of our game," Silver said in a statement.
          "Whether competing in the finals or hoisting jump shots after midnight
          in an empty gym, Kobe has an unconditional love for the game."</p
        >
        <p class="content"
          >On April 13, 2016, Bryant dazzled a sold-out crowd at the Staples
          Center and fans everywhere in the last game of his career, scoring 60
          points and leading the Lakers to a win against the Utah Jazz. It was
          Bryant’s sixth 60-point game of his career.</p
        >
        <p class="content"
          >After the game, Bryant spoke to the crowd. "I can't believe how fast
          20 years went by," he said. "This is absolutely crazy ... and to be
          standing at center court with you guys, my teammates behind me,
          appreciating the journey that we've been on — we've been through our
          ups, been through our downs. I think the most important part is we all
          stayed together throughout."</p
        >
        <p class="content"
          >An all-star lineup of Laker icons also paid tribute to Bryant,
          including O’Neal, Phil Jackson, Pau Gasol, Derek Fisher, Lamar Odom
          and Magic Johnson. "We are here to celebrate greatness for 20 years,"
          Johnson said. "Excellence for 20 years. Kobe Bryant has never cheated
          the game, never cheated us as the fans. He has played through injury,
          he has played hurt. And we have five championship banners to show for
          it."</p
